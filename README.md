# My_rpg Project 

## Dev Team

This project was made thanks to 
- [Edouard Pradie](https://www.github.com/EdouardPradie)
- [Alexis Faure](https://github.com/FaureAlexis)
- [Nolann Bougrainville](https://github.com/NolannB14)
- [Adrien Ricou](https://github.com/Gradrien)

## Install game

`git clone https://github.com/NolannB14/my_rpg.git Hasbulla_Quest`

## Run game

`make; ./my_rpg`

## Goal of the project

The last CSFML project of the 1st EPITECH year consists on recreating a fully playable role play video game (RPG).
The game must have many features and a scenario. It was made in 7 weeks and aim to work on team working, organization and code structure.

## Features

For the project to be evaluated, we must complete the following requirements such as follows :

  ### Mandatory
  The following features are mandatory (if the project is missing one of them it will not be evaluated further):
  
   • the window can be closed using events \
    • the game manages the input from the mouse click and keyboard \
    • the game contains animated sprites rendered thanks to sprite sheets \
    • animations in your program are frame rate independent \
    • animations and movements in your program are timed by clocks 
  ### Technical Requierements
  The following requierement are the mathematical and technical parts which has to be present in your final project:
  
   • A collision system including moving and static elements with different shapes \
    • A simple particle system that can display at least 2 types of particles \
    • Particle effects (changing colors, scaling, bouncing, fading) to simulate realistic environment (wind, fire, rain, snow...) \
    • Camera movements (zoom, translation, rotation) \
    • 3D effects (depth scaling, isometric projection. . . )
  ### Must
  The game must have:
  
   • A starting menu with at least two buttons, one to launch a game, and one to quit the game \
    • An escape key to pause the game when launched \
    • A menu when the game is paused with at least two buttons, one to go to the starting menu and the other to leave the game \
    • A basic fighting system \
    • An inventory and status menu
  ### Should
  
   • Your window should stick between 800x600 pixels and 1920x1080 pixels \
    • The game should have an “How To play” menu, explaining how to play your game \
    • The game should have NPC with whom the player can interact (fight, quest, discuss) \
    • As much information as possible about the game should be stored in a configuration file \
    • The buttons in your game should have at least three visual states: idle, hover, and clicked \
    • If your game has cut scenes or an animated intro (and it should) the player should be able to skip it \
    • The game should have a beginning and an end \
    • The game should have an advanced collision system to manage complex fighting
  ### Could
  The game could:
  
   • let the player save and load its own save \
    • let the user customize its character \
    • have different types of enemies \
    • have a skill tree, unlocking different abilities (active and passive) \
    • have a “settings” menu that could contain sound options and/or screen size options \
    • have a particle engine \
    • use scripting to describe entities \
    • have a map editor \
  ### Would
  Your program would be a real video game

## History

Good morning intrepid young adventurer and welcome to the world of the king Hasbullah. \
